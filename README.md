## Hi there 👋  I'm Darren Monk – Serial Entrepreneur, People Person & Web3 Adventurer

I'm a big believer in technology that empowers people. My journey has taken me from launching a print magazine (just before the dot-com boom!) to scaling a £2M+ e-commerce business — and currently, diving headfirst into the wild world of Web3.

After getting stung a few times on the decentralized frontier, I've set out to build something better. Something fairer. Something fun. That’s why I founded **3WiseApes.com** — to create real utility, real community, and real wisdom in a space that desperately needs it.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on...

**🚀 The 3WiseApes (3WA) Project**  
A next-gen, story-rich, gamified NFT collection built on Ethereum. Featuring:
- 🧠 Wisdom-driven character evolution
- 🧬 Trait-based roles and DAO voting
- 🎮 Game-friendly mechanics (ERC-721A, ERC-6551)
- 🎁 Access Card perks linked to 3Society.com
- 🔐 No financial promises — just great vibes, community utility, and Web3 ethics
